# List Operations in Python

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates basic list operations. The script shows how to:

- Create an empty list.
- Append elements to a list.
- Insert an element at a specific position.
- Extend a list with another list.
- Remove the last element.
- Sort the list in ascending order.
- Find and print the index of a specific value.

## Code Description

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Create and Modify a List**  
   - Start with an empty list.
   - Add elements (10, 20, 30, 40) using `append()`.
   - Insert the value `15` at the second position using `insert()`.

2. **Extend and Modify the List**  
   - Extend the list with `[50, 60, 70]` using `extend()`.
   - Remove the last element using `pop()`.

3. **Sort and Search the List**  
   - Sort the list in ascending order using `sort()`.
   - Find the index of the value `30` using `index()`.

## Example Output

After performing all operations, the list will be:
```python
[10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
